## Setup
Clone or download this repository then, run ```npm install``` to fetch the dependencies (requires Internet connection).

## Development
Other browsers such as chrome require index.html to be hosted, so either (1) move the repository folder to a htdocs folder, or (2) run ```php -S localhost:8888 -t repository-folder```.

Then run ```npm run weebopack``` then open index.html in the browser. 

## Deployment
run ```./build```
